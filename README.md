# V92 Config & Downloader for Garry's Mod

A simple faux gamemode script that adds my unique prefixed maps into their own map category.

Also includes a script that adds the maps dynamically to resource.AddWorkshop based on when they're needed. Maps will be downloaded to the client as-needed as long as the client has this file. With this file you do not need to put the maps into your collection. The server will send the required file to the client when it is needed.

This script is open source, as long as you also make any deviations open source.
